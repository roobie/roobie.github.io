### [ Remacs ][remacs-gh] - Emacs in rust

### [ Alacritty ][alacritty-announcement] - OpenGL powered terminal emulator

Lately I've been using [ Sakura ][sakura-home] as my preferred terminal emulator and tmux as
the multiplexer. But it was not too long ago I switched from using
[ Terminator ][terminator-lp] (which has built in multiplexing functions). Terminator is somewhat slow with its output, whereas Sakura is pretty darn fast. The faster output of
Sakura has really made a difference in my CLI-life, which is why I find Alacritty really
interesting.

### [ Redox ][redox-gh] - a new OS

### [ ripgrep ][rg-gh] - RIP grep

### [ Awesome rust ][rust-awesome] - The list of awesome rust code and resources
