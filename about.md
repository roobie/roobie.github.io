Greetings!

My name is Björn Roberg and I'm a programming nerd.
In early 2017 I set out to actually publish my thoughts on things
that are interesting to me. My aim with this site is to dicuss and delve a bit
into open source software, for the sake of learning more about programming,
open source and software development in general. And so I thought that if I learn from it,
then maybe other people can too. Hence this site.

Happy hacking, to you.
