description: Notes on terminal multiplexers.

Long have I used `tmux`, and been pretty happy with it.

Today I'm trying `[zellij](https://zellij.dev/documentation/introduction.html)` and it's really nice right out of the box.

`zellij` says this of itself:

> A terminal workspace with batteries included

Tabs, panes, visible keybinds that also are mnemonic. TUI chrome, but not too much.

Recommended!
